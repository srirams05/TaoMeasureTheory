Below is a (necessarily incomplete) “tool‐kit” of standard methods and “tricks” frequently employed in real analysis and measure theory in $\mathbb{R}^d$.  They appear repeatedly in proofs of classical theorems and estimates, and many of them have been famously described as “an epsilon in the room” by Terence Tao.  The list is grouped by theme for convenience; in practice these techniques often blend together.  
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

1) Epsilon–Delta / Epsilon–N Arguments  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• (Classical) $\varepsilon$--$\delta$ proofs.    
  The most basic limiting procedure: given $\varepsilon > 0$, find a $\delta > 0$ (or other small parameter) ensuring a certain property holds.  Used everywhere from basic topology (defining continuity) to measure‐theoretic convergence statements.  
   
• $\varepsilon/2^n$ (or “halving”) trick.    
  Instead of trying to fit an entire small $\varepsilon$ at once, one splits an $\varepsilon$ into (finitely or countably many) smaller pieces $\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}, \tfrac{\varepsilon}{4}, \dots$ so that each piece can be handled more easily.  Often seen in proofs of uniform convergence or in constructing countable covers.  
   
• Spending a small $\varepsilon$.    
  A flexible language introduced by Tao to refer to any step where one purposely “loses” a small amount $\varepsilon$ in an estimate, so that the rest of the argument becomes simpler.    
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

2) Coverings, Dyadic Decompositions, and Grids  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• Dyadic cubes $Q_{n,k}$.    
  In $\mathbb{R}^d$, one partitions the space by closed “dyadic cubes” of side length $2^{-n}$.  These cubes typically align to a grid scaled by powers of 2, i.e.    
  $$  
    Q_{n,k} \;=\; \Bigl[\tfrac{k_1}{2^n},\,\tfrac{k_1+1}{2^n}\Bigr)\times \cdots \times \Bigl[\tfrac{k_d}{2^n},\,\tfrac{k_d+1}{2^n}\Bigr),  
  $$  
  where $k=(k_1,\dots,k_d)\in \mathbb{Z}^d$.  Dyadic decompositions are essential in constructing step‐wise approximations, covering lemmas, and in Calderón–Zygmund‐type arguments in harmonic analysis.  
   
• The Vitali covering lemma / Besicovitch covering lemma.    
  Statements ensuring that from a (possibly huge) family of sets, one can extract a countable subfamily that still covers “most” of the original set.  Vitali’s lemma is often used to prove differentiability a.e. for monotone or convex functions, and to show “almost all points are of density one.”  
   
• Whitney decomposition.    
  A technique to decompose an open set into disjoint cubes whose sidelengths reflect the distance to the boundary of the set.  Widely used in PDEs and real analysis to localize estimates near the boundary.  
   
• Tiling / Lattice arguments.    
  Often $\mathbb{R}^d$ is covered by translates of a fixed shape (e.g., cubes, balls).  One uses geometry in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ to index and keep track of where the function or set is large/small.  
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

3) Truncation and Layer‐Cake‐Type Techniques  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• Splitting according to size (large–small decomposition).    
  In integrals or measure estimates, one often splits a function $f$ into $f = f\mathbf{1}_{\{|f|>M\}} + f\mathbf{1}_{\{|f|\le M\}}$, then chooses $M$ so that each piece is controlled.  In measure arguments, one splits a domain into regions $\{\,|f|>M\}$ and $\{\,|f|\le M\}$.  
   
• Truncation arguments.    
  For instance, replace an integrable $f$ by $f_N := \max(\min(f,N), -N)$.  This bounded (and often simple) function is easier to handle, and then let $N\to \infty$.  Used in proofs of dominated and monotone convergence, and in approximation lemmas.  
   
• Layer‐cake representation.    
  A technique rewriting a nonnegative measurable function $f(x)$ as  
  $$  
    f(x) \;=\; \int_0^\infty \mathbf{1}_{\{f(x)>t\}}\, dt.  
  $$  
  Integrals of $f$ can often be swapped for integrals in the “$t$” variable involving measures of level sets $\{x : f(x)>t\}$.  Useful in $L^p$ estimates.  
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

4) Approximation Schemes and Convergence Theorems  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• Simple function / step function approximation.    
  A standard way to handle a general measurable function is to approximate it from below (or above) by step functions (finite linear combinations of characteristic functions of measurable sets).  This underlies many proofs in Lebesgue integration theory.  
   
• Mollifiers and approximate identities.    
  Convolution with a smooth “bump” function that integrates to 1 yields a smooth approximation $f*\varphi_\varepsilon$.  This is crucial in PDE and real analysis for approximating arbitrary $L^p$ or continuous functions by smooth ones, without losing control of norms.  
   
• Egoroff’s theorem and Lusin’s theorem.    
  – Egoroff: on a set of arbitrarily large measure, a sequence of a.e. convergent functions converges uniformly.    
  – Lusin: any measurable function is continuous (indeed, even smooth if you also use mollifiers) on a large portion of its domain, except for a small set of arbitrarily small measure.  
   
• Dominated / Monotone Convergence Theorems; Fatou’s lemma.    
  Fundamental theorems that permit interchanging limits and integrals under appropriate hypotheses (dominance by integrable function, or monotonicity).  
   
• Fubini–Tonelli theorems.    
  Allow switching the order of integration.  Often stated as: if $f\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}^k)$, then almost every slice is integrable and    
  $$  
    \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+k}} f(x,y)\, d(x,y)   
    \;=\;  
    \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \Bigl(\int_{\mathbb{R}^k} f(x,y)\,dy\Bigr)\, dx.  
  $$  
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

5) Covering Numbers, $\sigma$-Finiteness, and Outer Regularity  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• Decomposing into $\sigma$-finite pieces.    
  Many measure‐theoretic arguments require the ambient $\sigma$-algebra or measure space to be $\sigma$-finite.  In $\mathbb{R}^d$, one often restricts to bounded sets, or breaks $\mathbb{R}^d$ into regions of finite measure to reduce to simpler cases.  
   
• Carathéodory outer measure construction.    
  The standard approach to building Lebesgue measure.  It is also a method: showing that a certain “outer measure” is actually a proper measure often uses Carathéodory’s criterion (the measure is translation invariant, subadditive, etc.).  
   
• Regularity of Lebesgue measure.    
  Inner regularity (approximate sets from inside by compact sets) and outer regularity (approximate from outside by open sets).  Often used to pass from sets to nicer sets in measure estimates.  
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

6) “Almost Everywhere” and Null Sets  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• “Ignore a set of measure zero”.    
  A ubiquitous mantra in measure theory: if something happens “outside a set of arbitrarily small measure,” it still holds almost everywhere.  We often systematically discard such null sets to simplify arguments.  
   
• Cantor‐type constructions and pathological sets.    
  The Cantor set is a classic example of a complicated set of measure zero.  Used to exhibit subtleties in measure/analysis (e.g., nowhere‐dense sets of full Hausdorff dimension, etc.).  
   
• Borel–Cantelli lemmas.    
  Statements about when infinitely many events (in measure‐theoretic or probabilistic language) occur, based on summing measures.  They often appear in real analysis to show certain points lie in infinitely many sets (or only finitely many).  
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

7) Inequalities, Large–Small Splits, and “Good‐$\lambda$” Methods  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• Chebyshev / Markov / Tchebychev inequalities.    
  Provide estimates of the measure of $\{|f| > \alpha\}$ by $\frac{1}{\alpha}\int |f|$.  A one‐line trick that is often the starting point of bigger arguments (e.g. showing a function belongs to $L^p$).  
   
• Good–$\lambda$ inequalities.    
  A technique to prove strong $L^p$ estimates by splitting the domain into “good” regions (where the function is relatively small but not too small) and “bad” regions (where the function is large).  Well‐known in harmonic analysis (Calderón–Zygmund theory).  
   
• Absorbing constants.    
  If you have an inequality of the form    
  $$  
    A \;\le\; \frac{1}{2}A + C,  
  $$  
  you can rearrange to get $A \le 2C$.  In other words, “swallow” or “absorb” a fraction of the same quantity from the right‐hand side.  This is a prime example of spending an $\varepsilon$.  
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

8) Diagonalization and Exhaustion  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• Diagonal argument.    
  Transferring a property from a countable dense subset to the whole space by carefully selecting a sequence that works “for all $n$” simultaneously.  Also used in function spaces to extract a single subsequence that converges in multiple topologies at once.  
   
• Exhaustion by compact sets (or by bounded sets).    
  A typical argument goes: take an increasing union $K_1 \subset K_2 \subset \cdots$ of compact sets so that $\bigcup_n K_n = \Omega$.  Prove a fact on each $K_n$ (where the problem might be simpler), then let $n \to \infty$.    
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

9) Slicing, Layer‐Cake, and Geometric Arguments  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

• Cavalieri’s principle (“slicing”).    
  Relates the volume (integral) of a set/function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the measures of its slices in lower dimensions, e.g.    
  $$  
    \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f(x)\,dx   
    \;=\;   
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Bigl(\int_{\{x_1 = t\}\subset \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)\,d x_2\!\cdots dx_d \Bigr) dt.  
  $$  
  A powerful way to reduce some $d$-dimensional problems to (d$-1$)-dimensional ones.  
   
• Coarea formula.    
  A generalization of Cavalieri’s principle for nonnegative functions $\varphi$, expressing    
  $$  
    \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} g(x)\,\|\nabla \varphi(x)\|\;dx   
    \;=\;   
    \int_{0}^\infty \Bigl(\int_{\{\varphi = t\}} g \,dS\Bigr)\,dt.  
  $$  
  Widely used in geometric measure theory and PDE.  
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

10) Putting It All Together  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Many proofs in real analysis and measure theory can be summarized as follows:  
   
1. Fix $\varepsilon>0$.    
2. Decompose the domain (often via dyadic cubes, Vitali covers, or slicing) so that each piece is well‐controlled.    
3. Truncate or approximate the function (simple function approximation, layer‐cake, or mollifier).    
4. Apply a convergence theorem (Dominated, Monotone).    
5. “Lose” an $\varepsilon$ if needed to handle boundary issues, measure‐zero sets, or uniform convergence on large compact subsets.    
6. Conclude the argument by letting $\varepsilon \to 0$.    
  
These standard techniques—Tao’s “epsilons in the room”—reoccur throughout analysis.  Mastery of them is essential for tackling the typical “measure‐theoretic lemmas” (e.g., Fubini, Vitali, Borel–Cantelli, approximation theorems, etc.) and viewing advanced topics (Calderón–Zygmund decomposition, maximal functions, geometric measure theory, PDEs) in their natural light.  
   
While the list above is already extensive, there are many more localized “tricks” (e.g., Rademacher’s theorem on a.e. differentiability, Whitney extension theorems, special iterations in ergodic theory, etc.).  However, the vast majority can be seen as variations or combinations of the fundamental methods surveyed here.
